1. Add a person to the collection. You pick the data, but they should have an empty array for children.
    db.people.insertOne({ first_name: 'JoAnna',
  last_name: 'Ruiz',
  email: 'jruizu@google.com',
  gender: 'Female',
  age: 29,
  state: 'Idaho',
  children: [] })

  2. Add another person. They should have at least two children.
   db.people.insertOne({ first_name: 'James',
  last_name: 'Rodney',
  email: 'jrodney@google.com',
  gender: 'Male',
  age: 35,
  state: 'Iowa',
  children: [{name: 'Jim', age: 4}, {name: 'Janie', age: 2}] })

  3. Update one person named Clarence. He moved from North Dakota to South Dakota.
  db.people.updateOne({first_name: 'Clarence'}, {
      $set: {
          state: 'South Dakota'
      }
  })

  4. Update Rebecca Hayes. Remove her email address.
  db.people.updateOne({first_name: 'Rebecca'}, {
      $unset: {
          email: ''
      }
  })

  5. Update everyone from Missouri. They all had a birthday today, so add one to their age. (expect 4 matches)
  db.people.updateMany({state: 'Missouri'}, {
      $inc: {age: +1}
  })

  6. Jerry Baker has updated information. Replace with a new document:
  db.people.updateOne({first_name: "Jerry"}, {
      $set: {first_name: "Jerry", last_name: "Baker-Mendez", email: "jerry@classic.ly", gender:"Male", age: 28, state: "Vermont", "children": [{name: "Alan", age: 18}, {name: "Jenny", age: 3}] }})

  7.  Delete Wanda Bowman.
  db.people.deleteOne({first_name: "Wanda"})

  8. Delete everyone who does not have an email address specified. (expect 36 matches - maybe more depending what you added above)
  db.people.deleteMany({email: null})

  9. Add several documents to a new submissions collection. Do it all in one command. (Remember, MongoDB will create the collection for you. Just start adding documents.)
        {title: "The River Bend", upvotes: 10, downvotes: 2, artist: <ID of Anna Howard>},
        {title: "Nine Lives", upvotes: 7, downvotes: 0, artist: <ID of Scott Henderson>},
        {title: "Star Bright", upvotes: 19, downvotes: 3, artist: <ID of Andrea Burke>},
        {title: "Why Like This?", upvotes: 1, downvotes: 5, artist: <ID of Steven Marshall>},
        {title: "Non Sequitur", upvotes: 11, downvotes: 1, artist: <ID of Gerald Bailey>}
    db.submissions.insertMany(
        [{title: "The River Bend", upvotes: 10, downvotes: 2, artist:'Anna Howard'},
        {title: "Nine Lives", upvotes: 7, downvotes: 0, artist:'Scott Henderson'},
        {title: "Star Bright", upvotes: 19, downvotes: 3, artist:'Andrea Burke'},
        {title: "Why Like This?", upvotes: 1, downvotes: 5, artist:'Steven Marshall'},
        {title: "Non Sequitur", upvotes: 11, downvotes: 1, artist:'Gerald Bailey'}]
    )

10. Add 2 upvotes for "The River Bend".
    db.submissions.updateOne({title: "The River Bend"}, {
        $inc: {upvotes: +2}
    })

11. Add a field round2 = true to all submissions with at least 10 upvotes. (expect 3 matches)
    db.submissions.updateMany({upvotes: {$gte: 10},{
        $set: {round2 : true}
    }, 
    {
        upsert: true,
        multi: true}
    })
